## Features

The dashboard includes the following insights:

### Financial Impact
- **Total Savings**: Savings generated from the 340B program.
- **Savings Percentage**: Percentage saved compared to regular prices.
- **Total Purchased Value**: Cost of drugs purchased under the program.

### Drug Utilization
- **Quantity Purchased vs Dispensed**: Track utilization rates.
- **Utilization Rate**: Efficiency of drug dispensation.

### Patient Demographics
- **Eligible Patient Count**: Patients served by the 340B program.
- **Patient Age and Gender Distribution**: Analyze accessibility trends.
- **Insurance Status**: Breakdown by insured vs uninsured patients.

### Location-Based Performance
- **Dispensing by Location**: Identify high-performing regions.
- **Savings by Location**: Evaluate cost-effectiveness regionally.

## Data Source

The dataset for this project was generated using the **Faker** library for simulating synthetic data and **Pandas** for data processing. These libraries helped create a realistic dataset with fields necessary for 340B program analysis.

### Key Fields
- `entity_id`, `entity_type`, `drug_id`, `drug_name`, `drug_category`
- `purchase_price`, `regular_price`, `quantity_purchased`, `quantity_dispensed`
- `eligible_patient_count`, `patient_age`, `patient_gender`
- `insurance_status`, `adverse_events`, `location`, `purchase_date`, `dispensing_date`

### Data Generation Script

The `generate_data.py` script generates the dataset:
- **Faker**: Simulates fields such as drug names, patient demographics, purchase dates, and dispensing dates.
- **Pandas**: Structures the data into a DataFrame for easy analysis and export.
